# Story features

- First one should always be my own.
- If I don't have active stories, then it should lead to /story/new where I can create new story
- Else it should lead me to /story/\[id] where I am able to see my own story.
- If story I'm currently watching is mine, allow me to access story settings, where I'll be able to delete, edit...
